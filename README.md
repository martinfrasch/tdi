This contains links to the datasets from
1) USPTO: https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/electronic-data-products/patent-examination-research-dataset-public-pair
2) crunchbase open data map: https://data.crunchbase.com/docs/2013-snapshot
I cannot provide the actual mysqldump from crunchbase here, because the API key is uniquely generated upon request (takes a few minutes to get it).
I used rebasedata.com cloud service to convert sql dumps to csv format. I found that the github python script available for that did not work yielding error messages I did not have the time to iron out just yet. (It may have to do with my UTF code settings.)
